Miners select unconfirmed transactions from their mempools and arrange them into a block such that they solve a particular math problem.<p>The first miner on the network to find a suitable block earns all the transaction fees from the transactions in that block.

  <p>Virtual bytes (vB) and weight units (WU) are used to measure the size of transactions and blocks on the Bitcoin network.</p>
  <p>A Bitcoin transaction's size in the blockchain is <i>not</i> determined how much bitcoin it transfersâ€”instead, a transaction's size is determined by technical factors such as how many inputs and outputs it has, how many signatures it has, and the format it uses (legacy, SegWit, etc). Since space in the Bitcoin blockchain is limited, bigger transactions pay more in mining fees than smaller transactions.</p>
  <p>Block sizes are limited to 4,000,000 WU (or 1,000,000 vB since 1 vB = 4 WU).</p>
  <p>Transaction sizes and block sizes used to be measured in plain bytes, but virtual bytes and weight units were devised to maintain backward compatibility after the SegWit upgrade in 2017.

  <p>There are 3 ways to increase the incentive for a miner to include your transaction</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><b>Replace By Fee (RBF)</b></p>
      <p>If you are the sender in a bitcoin transaction you can create a new transaction which spends the same inputs but with a higher fee.</p>
      <p>Full RBF miners will mine blocks containing your replacement even if you don't flag RBF, but you may have issues propagating the transaction. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Child Pays for Parent (CPFP)</b></p>
      <p>If you are the recipient of an unconfirmed transaction output you can spend it and increase the effective fee (the weighted average of both the original unconfirmed transaction and your CPFP transaction).</p>
      <p>A miner can't confirm a CPFP transaction without also confirming the original, making it impossible for the miner to take the fee from your CPFP unless  your unconfirmed original transaction is included in the same (or a previous) block.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Out of Band</b></p>

<ng-template type="looking-up-historical-trends">
  See the <a [routerLink]="['/graphs' | relativeUrl]">graphs page</a> for aggregate trends over time: mempool size over time and incoming transaction velocity over time.
</ng-template>

<ng-template type="what-is-full-mempool">
  <p>When a Bitcoin transaction is made, it is stored in a Bitcoin node's mempool before it is confirmed into a block. When the rate of incoming transactions exceeds the rate transactions are confirmed, the mempool grows in size.</p><p>By default, Bitcoin Core allocates 300MB of memory for its mempool, so when a node's mempool grows big enough to use all 300MB of allocated memory, we say it's "full".</p><p>Once a node's mempool is using all of its allocated memory, it will start rejecting new transactions below a certain feerate thresholdâ€”so when this is the case, be extra sure to set a feerate that (at a minimum) exceeds that threshold. The current threshold feerate (and memory usage) are displayed right on Mempool's front page.</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template type="how-big-is-mempool-used-by-mempool-space">
  <p>mempool.space uses multiple Bitcoin nodes to obtain data: some with the default 300MB mempool memory limit (call these Small Nodes) and others with a much larger mempool memory limit (call these Big Nodes).</p>
  <p>Many nodes on the Bitcoin network are configured to run with the default 300MB mempool memory setting. When all 300MB of memory are used up, such nodes will reject transactions below a certain threshold feerate. Running Small Nodes allows mempool.space to tell you what this threshold feerate isâ€”this is the "Purging" feerate that shows on the front page when mempools are full, which you can use to be reasonably sure that your transaction will be widely propagated.</p>
    <p>Big Node mempools are so big that they don't need to reject (or purge) transactions. Such nodes allow for mempool.space to provide you with information on any pending transaction it has receivedâ€”no matter how congested the mempool is, and no matter how low-feerate or low-priority the transaction is.</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template type="what-is-memory-usage">
  <p>Memory usage on the front page refers to the real-time amount of system memory used by a Bitcoin node's mempool. This memory usage number is always higher than the total size of all pending transactions in the mempool due to indexes, pointers, and other overhead used by Bitcoin Core for storage and processing.</p>
  <p>mempool.space shows the memory usage of a Bitcoin node that has a very high mempool memory limit. As a result, when mempools fill up, you may notice memory usage on mempool.space go beyond 300MB. This is not a mistakeâ€”this memory usage figure is high because it's for a Bitcoin node that isn't rejecting (or evicting) transactions. Consider it to be another data point to give you an idea of how congested the mempool is relative to the default memory limit of 300MB.</p>
  <p>A Bitcoin node running the default 300MB mempool memory limit, like most Raspberry Pi nodes, will never go past 300MB of memory usage.</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template type="why-empty-blocks">
  <p>When a new block is found, mining pools send miners a block template with no transactions so they can start searching for the next block as soon as possible. They send a block template full of transactions right afterward, but a full block template is a bigger data transfer and takes slightly longer to reach miners.</p><p>In this intervening time, which is usually no more than 1-2 seconds, miners sometimes get lucky and find a new block using the empty block template.</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template type="why-block-timestamps-dont-always-increase">
  <p>Block validation rules do not strictly require that a block's timestamp be more recent than the timestamp of the block preceding it. Without a central authority, it's impossible to know what the exact correct time is. Instead, the Bitcoin protocol requires that a block's timestamp meet certain requirements. One of those requirements is that a block's timestamp cannot be older than the median timestamp of the 12 blocks that came before it. See more details <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_timestamp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>As a result, timestamps are only accurate to within an hour or so, which sometimes results in blocks with timestamps that appear out of order.</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template type="why-dont-fee-ranges-match">
  <p>Mempool aims to show you the <i>effective feerate</i> range for blocksâ€”how much would you actually need to pay to get a transaction included in a block.</p>
  <p>A transaction's effective feerate is not always the same as the feerate explicitly set for it. For example, if you see a 1 s/vb transaction in a block with a displayed feerate range of 5 s/vb to 72 s/vb, chances are that 1 s/vb transaction had a high-feerate child transaction that boosted its effective feerate to 5 s/vb or higher (this is how CPFP fee-bumping works). In such a case, it would be misleading to use 1 s/vb as the lower bound of the block's feerate range since it actually required more than 1 s/vb to confirm that transaction in that block.</p>
  <p>You can find a transaction's feerate on its transaction details page. If the transaction has any CPFP relationships, the page will also show the transaction's effective feerate along with links to descendent and/or ancestor transactions.</p>

<ng-template type="how-do-block-audits-work">
  <p>A block audit visually compares Mempool's expected block to the actual block for a particular block height.</p>
  <p>How is the expected block determined? Mempool monitors its view of the mempool and runs a re-implementation of Bitcoin Core's transaction selection algorithm to determine the transactions it expects to see in upcoming blocks (<a href="https://github.com/mempool/mempool/blob/master/backend/src/api/mempool-blocks.ts" target="_blank">source code here</a>). Since there is a continual flow of new transactions, this algorithm runs every 2 seconds, and as a result, you will see the transactions <a href="/mempool-block/0">projected to be in upcoming blocks</a> change in near real-time.</p>
  <p>At the moment a new block is mined, Mempool saves a snapshot of its projected block template for the next block. We call this snapshot the <b>expected block</b> for the block height in question, and it serves as the basis for the block audit.</p>
  <p>When details for an expected block and actual block are available, we can compare them. <b>The purpose of block audits is to deduce when miners intentionally include or exclude transactions from blocks they mine.</b> Since this information cannot be precisely known, Mempool uses a handful of heuristics to accomplish this.</p>
  <p>Block audits highlight transactions in different colors to convey these heuristics:</p>
  <ul class="no-bull block-audit">
    <li><span class="block-audit-highlight-color added">â– </span><code>Added</code><p>A transaction is highlighted blue if it is not present in the expected block, present in the actual block, and also either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>far out of the expected feerate range, meaning the miner may have intentionally prioritized the transaction</li>
      <li>not in the mempool at all, meaning the miner may have accepted the transaction out-of-band</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Added transactions do not negatively affect <a [routerLink]="['/docs/faq' | relativeUrl]" fragment="what-is-block-health">block health</a>.</p></li>
    <li><span class="block-audit-highlight-color recent">â– </span><code>Recently broadcasted</code><p>A transaction is highlighted dark pink if it is present in the expected block, not present in the actual block, and was first seen by Mempool's Bitcoin node within 3 minutes of the block being mined.</p><p>Due to network latency and other factors, it can take time for a miner's Bitcoin nodes to receive a transaction, so we do not assume a miner has intentionally excluded such a transaction from a block.</p><p>Recently-broadcasted transactions do not negatively affect <a [routerLink]="['/docs/faq' | relativeUrl]" fragment="what-is-block-health">block health</a>.</p></li>
    <li><span class="block-audit-highlight-color marginal">â– </span><code>Marginal fee</code>
    <p>A transaction is darkened if it is in the low end of the expected feerate range and missing in either the expected block or the actual block.</p><p>Such a transaction may have been displaced by an added transaction, or it may have been displaced by another transaction from the mempool that was also at the low end of the expected feerate range for the block. In either case, the deviation is not considered notable.</p>
    <p>Marginal fee transactions do not negatively affect <a [routerLink]="['/docs/faq' | relativeUrl]" fragment="what-is-block-health">block health</a>.</p></li>
    <li><span class="block-audit-highlight-color removed">â– </span><code>Removed</code><p>A transaction is highlighted bright pink if it is present in the expected block, not present in the actual block, and qualifies as neither recently-broadcasted nor marginal-fee. In other words, it has been in the mempool long enough to be widely propagated and has a feerate that is well within the range expected for the block. There is a chance such a transaction may have been intentionally excluded from the block.<p>Removed transactions do negatively affect <a [routerLink]="['/docs/faq' | relativeUrl]" fragment="what-is-block-health">block health</a>.</p></li>

<ng-template type="what-is-block-health">
  <p>Block health is a measure of how many transactions appear to be intentionally excluded from a blockâ€”a block without any transactions that appear intentionally excluded will have 100% health, while a block with 1 or more transactions that appear intentionally excluded will have sub-100% health.</p>
  <p>How is it calculated? Let <span class='math'>s<sub>expected</sub></span> be the set of all transactions in Mempool's expected block and let <span class='math'>s<sub>actual</sub></span> be the set of all transactions in the actual block. Then let <span class='math'>n</span> be the number of all transactions in both <span class='math'>s<sub>expected</sub></span> and <span class='math'>s<sub>actual</sub></span>.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, let <span class='math'>r</span> be the number of transactions Mempool deduces were <a [routerLink]="['/docs/faq' | relativeUrl]" fragment="how-do-block-audits-work">intentionally excluded</a> from <span class='math'>s<sub>actual</sub></span>.</p>
  <p>Block health is calculated as <span class='math'>n / ( n + r</span> ).</p>
  <p>The number of transactions appearing in both <span class='math'>s<sub>expected</sub></span> and <span class='math'>s<sub>actual</sub></span> is used (instead of a block's full transaction count) in order to minimize chances that block health is inadvertently impacted by transactions that were most likely not intentionally excluded:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>recently-broadcast transactions, since the miner may simply not have received them</li>
    <li>certain low-feerate transactions, since the miner may have opted to replace them with more profitable out-of-band transactions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a result, block health is <i>not</i> intended to be a measure of how closely an expected block resembles an actual block. The actual block can be vastly different from the expected block, but if no transactions appear to be intentionally excluded, it will have a high health rating (<a [routerLink]="['/block/0000000000000000000515e202c8ae73c8155fc472422d7593af87aa74f2cf3d']">extreme example</a>).</p>

  <p>If you're getting errors when doing address lookups, it's probably because of your Electrum server backend.</p><p>Mempool uses an Electrum server to do address lookups.

This is a common choice for its low resource requirements, and most full-node distros use it.

<ng-template type="account-requirement">
  <p>The blockspace market will change between the time when a user requests a transaction acceleration and the time that one of our mining partners finds a block. At the time of making an acceleration request it is not possible to know what bid will be sufficient to get into the next block mined by our mining partners, therefore it is not possible to know how much the user should pay.</p>
  <p>For this reason, at launch is is necessary to <a href="https://mempool.space/signup" target="_blank">sign up for an account</a> to use the Mempool Acceleratorâ„¢. Having an account makes it possible to place a hold on user balance while awaiting an acceleration, and retrospectively charge customers the appropriate market rate, leaving the remaining balance for subsequent transaction accelerations. This makes the service very convenient for high volume users who can make many accelerations with a single deposit into their Mempool account.</p>
  <p>We know that some users would prefer to pay per acceleration without using an account, and we hope to develop this functionality in the future.</p>

<ng-template type="mempool-accelerator-improves-transparency">
  <p>Transaction prioritisation services have existed for much of bitcoin's history, and miners have always been able to choose which transactions are included in their blocks. By running this service with a commitment to transparency we hope to improve public access to blockspace market data, including out of band offers. This transparency is novel, current transaction prioritisation services are private and although transactions which were included as a result of out of band payments can be identified, the amount paid is not public data. Furthermore, these transactions can only be identified in retrospect, after a block has been mined wheres acceleration bids are shown public on Mempool Space when they are made.</p>
  <p>Mempool Acceleratorâ„¢ publishes data on all accelerated transactions for public access. This information is available both on the mempool.space accelerator website and via an API. By making this information public other entities within the bitcoin ecosystem can better understand current and historic blockspace market dynamics. </p>
  <p>"Fee estimation" algorithms can only utilize data which they have access to, and historically "Fee Estimation" algorithms have been blind to transaction prioritisations where out of band payments are made to miners or mining pools.</p>
  <p>By making this data public Mempool Acceleratorâ„¢ will ensure that "Fee Estimation" algorithms can take into account more transaction bid data (both in band and out of band).</p>
